title: "Extension Lifecycle"
description: "Extension tiers, promotion criteria, and governance model"
---

The extension lifecycle specification defines how OJS extensions progress from experimental ideas to stable core features. It establishes governance, versioning, and compatibility rules for the extension ecosystem.

## Extension Tiers

| Tier | Stability | Breaking Changes | Requirement |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Core | Stable | Major version only | Required at specific conformance levels |
| Official | Stable | Deprecation cycle required | Opt-in, documented |
| Experimental | Unstable | May break at any time | Opt-in, marked with warning |

## Extension Identification

Extensions are identified by URN:

| Tier | URN Pattern | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Core | `urn:ojs:spec:{name}` | `urn:ojs:spec:retry` |
| Official | `urn:ojs:ext:{name}` | `urn:ojs:ext:rate-limiting` |
| Experimental | `urn:ojs:ext:experimental:{name}` | `urn:ojs:ext:experimental:multi-tenancy` |
| Custom | `urn:ojs:ext:x:{vendor}:{name}` | `urn:ojs:ext:x:acme:billing` |

## Promotion Criteria

### Experimental → Official

1. Two or more independent implementations
2. Conformance tests written and passing
3. Eight-week community review period
4. Four-week stability period (no breaking changes)
5. Working group approval

### Official → Core

1. 80%+ adoption across known backends
2. Six or more months of production use
3. Consensus approval from maintainers
4. Backward-compatible integration with core spec

## Manifest Declaration

Backends declare supported extensions in their manifest:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0.0-rc.1",
  "extensions": [
    { "name": "retry", "uri": "urn:ojs:spec:retry", "version": "1.0.0" },
    { "name": "rate-limiting", "uri": "urn:ojs:ext:rate-limiting", "version": "1.0.0" },
    { "name": "multi-tenancy", "uri": "urn:ojs:ext:experimental:multi-tenancy", "version": "0.1.0" }
  ]
}
```

## SDK Negotiation

SDKs discover backend capabilities via the manifest and enable features conditionally:

```go
client, _ := ojs.NewClient("http://localhost:8080")
if client.Supports("rate-limiting") {
    // Use rate limiting features
}
```

## Extension Requirement Headers

Clients can require specific extensions, failing fast if the backend doesn't support them:

```
POST /ojs/v1/jobs
OJS-Requires-Extension: rate-limiting, unique-jobs
```

If the backend does not support a required extension, it returns 501 with the missing extension name.

## Community Process

1. **RFC proposal**: Submit an RFC with the extension design.
2. **Prototype**: Build a working prototype in at least one language.
3. **Review**: Working group review and feedback.
4. **Experimental release**: Publish as experimental with stability warnings.
5. **Promotion**: Meet promotion criteria for advancement.
