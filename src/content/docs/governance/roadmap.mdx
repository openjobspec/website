description: Planned direction for Open Job Spec — current status, upcoming milestones, and future directions.
---

This document outlines the planned direction for Open Job Spec. It is a living document updated as priorities evolve based on community feedback and adoption patterns.

## Current status

OJS is in **release candidate** stage (v1.0.0-rc.1). The core specification, 5 reference backends, 6 SDKs, CLI, Admin UI, and Playground are feature-complete and passing all conformance levels.

## v0.1.0 — First public release

**Goal:** Cut the first tagged release across all packages to enable adoption.

- Tag and publish all 12 packages (backends, SDKs, CLI)
- Publish SDKs to package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven Central, crates.io, RubyGems)
- Publish container images for all backends
- Finalize and publish the v1.0 specification

## v0.2.0 — Production hardening

**Goal:** Address feedback from early adopters and improve operational maturity.

- Extract shared Go backend code into `ojs-go-common` module
- Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing to all backends
- Add authentication middleware to Redis/NATS/Kafka/SQS backends (parity with Postgres)
- Cross-SDK integration tests (Go producer → JS consumer interop)
- gRPC conformance test runner (currently HTTP-only)
- Performance benchmarking suite with published results

## v0.3.0 — Ecosystem expansion

**Goal:** Expand integrations and lower the barrier to adoption.

- Terraform provider for deploying OJS clusters
- AMQP conformance test runner
- CloudEvents bridge (bidirectional job ↔ event mapping)
- Framework contrib packages stabilized (v1.0)
- Migration guides from Sidekiq, BullMQ, Celery (CLI + docs)
- Kubernetes operator stabilized (beta)

## Future directions

These are areas we are exploring but have not committed to timelines:

- **WASM SDK** — Browser-native OJS client for edge/serverless use cases
- **AI/ML job extensions** — GPU affinity, model versioning, resource requirements
- **Multi-region federation** — Cross-datacenter job routing and replication
- **Serverless adapters** — AWS Lambda, CloudFlare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions
- **Real-time chat community** — Discord or Slack for synchronous collaboration
