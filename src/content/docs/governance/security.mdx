title: Security Policy
description: How to report vulnerabilities, response timelines, and coordinated disclosure process.
---

This page covers vulnerability reporting for the OJS project. For the specification's security model (transport, authentication, authorization, input validation), see the [Security spec](/spec/security/).

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No     |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in any repository under the `openjobspec` organization, report it by emailing:

📧 **[security@openjobspec.org](mailto:security@openjobspec.org)**

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected repository and version
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

### Response timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| **Acknowledgment** | Within 48 hours of your report |
| **Initial assessment** | Within 7 days |
| **Fix release** | Within 30 days of confirmation |

### Coordinated disclosure process

1. Reporter submits vulnerability privately via email
2. We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and publish a security advisory
5. Reporter is credited (unless they prefer anonymity)

We ask that you allow up to **90 days** from initial report before public disclosure, to give us time to develop and release a proper fix.

### Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories under the [openjobspec](https://github.com/openjobspec) GitHub organization, including:

- All backend implementations
- All SDKs and contrib packages
- The specification itself
- CLI, Admin UI, Playground, and Kubernetes Operator

### Credit

We believe in recognizing the efforts of security researchers. With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in the security advisory and release notes.

## Security best practices for implementers

If you are implementing an OJS-compliant backend or SDK, review the [Security spec](/spec/security/) and [Encryption spec](/spec/encryption/) for requirements on transport security, authentication, authorization, and input validation.
