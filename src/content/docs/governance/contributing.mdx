description: How to contribute to the Open Job Spec project, including spec changes, SDKs, and backends.
---

Open Job Spec is an open-source project that welcomes contributions. This guide explains how to contribute to different parts of the project.

## Ways to contribute

| Area | Repository | How to help |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Specification | `spec/` | Propose RFCs, review drafts, improve clarity |
| Backends | `ojs-backend-redis/`, `ojs-backend-postgres/` | Fix bugs, add features, improve performance |
| SDKs | `ojs-*-sdk/` | Fix bugs, improve ergonomics, add missing features |
| Conformance | `ojs-conformance/` | Add test cases, improve coverage |
| JSON Schemas | `ojs-json-schema/` | Update schemas, add validation tests |
| Protobuf | `ojs-proto/` | Update service definitions |
| Documentation | `website/` | Improve guides, fix typos, add examples |

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a branch for your change.
4. Make your changes.
5. Run the relevant tests (see below).
6. Open a pull request.

## Specification changes

Changes to the specification follow the [RFC Process](/governance/rfc-process/). In short:

1. Open a GitHub issue describing the problem (not the solution).
2. Discuss with the community.
3. Write an RFC using the template in `spec/rfcs/RFC-0000-template.md`.
4. Open a PR with the RFC.
5. Iterate based on feedback.

Specification changes require at least two conforming implementations before acceptance.

**Writing style for spec text:**
- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) only when they carry normative meaning, and only in uppercase.
- Include a *Rationale* annotation for every MUST requirement.
- Reference prior art from existing systems.
- Keep language precise and unambiguous.

## Backend contributions

Both backends (Redis and PostgreSQL) are written in Go 1.22+ and share the same internal structure.

### Development setup

```bash
# Redis backend
cd ojs-backend-redis
make docker-up      # Start Redis + server
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run go vet
make conformance    # Run conformance tests

# PostgreSQL backend
cd ojs-backend-postgres
make docker-up      # Start PostgreSQL + server
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run go vet
```

### Code organization

Both backends follow the same three-layer pattern:

- `internal/api/` - HTTP handlers (chi router)
- `internal/core/` - Business logic interfaces
- `internal/redis/` or `internal/postgres/` - Storage implementation

When making changes, consider:
- Does the change need to be reflected in both backends?
- Does it affect conformance? Run `make conformance` to verify.
- Is the change covered by tests?

## SDK contributions

All SDKs follow the same pattern regardless of language. When contributing to an SDK:

### Before you start

- Read the [Core Concepts](/getting-started/concepts/) to understand the OJS model.
- Look at the existing SDK code to understand the pattern for that language.
- Check open issues for the SDK you want to contribute to.

### Language-specific guidelines

**Go SDK** (`ojs-go-sdk/`)
```bash
go test ./... -race -cover
go vet ./...
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript SDK** (`ojs-js-sdk/`)
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm test
pnpm run lint
```

**Python SDK** (`ojs-python-sdk/`)
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
mypy src/
ruff check .
```

**Java SDK** (`ojs-java-sdk/`)
```bash
mvn clean package
mvn test
```

**Rust SDK** (`ojs-rust-sdk/`)
```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

**Ruby SDK** (`ojs-ruby-sdk/`)
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

### SDK design principles

- **Thin clients.** SDKs are HTTP wrappers. All intelligence lives in the server.
- **Idiomatic code.** Follow the conventions of the target language. A Go SDK should feel like Go, a Python SDK should feel like Python.
- **Minimal dependencies.** Prefer stdlib where possible. The Ruby SDK uses zero external dependencies.
- **Full type safety.** Where the language supports it, provide strong types for job envelopes, errors, and configuration.
- **Test coverage.** Unit tests with mocked transport, integration tests against a real server.

## Documentation contributions

The documentation website uses Astro + Starlight and lives in the `website/` directory.

### Local development

```bash
cd website
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # Start dev server
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm preview      # Preview production build
```

### Writing style

- Conversational but technical. No marketing language.
- Use concrete code examples.
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or "and" instead.
- Keep explanations concise. Link to detailed spec pages rather than repeating content.

## Conformance test contributions

The conformance test suite in `ojs-conformance/` contains JSON test definitions and a Go test runner.

### Adding a test case

1. Identify the conformance level for your test (0-4).
2. Add a JSON test definition describing the HTTP request and expected response.
3. Run the tests against both official backends to verify.

```bash
cd ojs-conformance
OJS_URL=http://localhost:8080 go test ./runner/http/ -v
```

## Code of conduct

We expect all contributors to be respectful and constructive. Focus on the technical merits of proposals. Disagree with ideas, not people.
