Welcome to the **OJS Academy** — a structured learning path that takes you from zero to production with Open Job Spec.

## Learning Path

### Part 1: Your First Job

Get a working job system running in 5 minutes. Choose your language:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

| Language | Tutorial |
|----------|----------|
| 🟦 **Go** | [Your First Job in Go](/tutorials/your-first-job-go) |
| 🟨 **TypeScript** | [Your First Job in TypeScript](/tutorials/your-first-job-typescript) |
| 🐍 **Python** | [Your First Job in Python](/tutorials/your-first-job-python) |
| ☕ **Java** | [Your First Job in Java](/tutorials/your-first-job-java) |
| 🦀 **Rust** | [Your First Job in Rust](/tutorials/your-first-job-rust) |
| 💎 **Ruby** | [Your First Job in Ruby](/tutorials/your-first-job-ruby) |

</div>

**What you'll learn:** Install SDK → Start backend → Enqueue a job → Process it → See results

---

### Part 2: Workflows & Scheduling

Build real-world patterns: job chains, parallel fan-out, cron scheduling, and retry strategies.

→ [Workflow Patterns Tutorial](/tutorials/workflow-patterns)

**What you'll learn:** Chain (sequential) → Group (parallel) → Batch (callbacks) → Cron → Retry policies → Priority queues

---

### Part 3: Migrating from Other Frameworks

Step-by-step migration from your current job framework to OJS.

| From | Guide |
|------|-------|
| Sidekiq (Ruby) | [Migrating from Sidekiq](/getting-started/migration-calculator) |
| BullMQ (Node) | [Migrating from BullMQ](/getting-started/migration-calculator) |
| Celery (Python) | [Migrating from Celery](/getting-started/migration-calculator) |

**What you'll learn:** Map job types → Convert workers → Switch backends → Validate with conformance tests

---

### Part 4: Observability & Debugging

Monitor, debug, and optimize your OJS deployment.

**Topics covered:**
- Setting up Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Using the Admin UI
- CLI debugging commands (`ojs debug`, `ojs monitor`)
- Auto-tuning recommendations

---

### Part 5: Production Deployment

Deploy OJS to production with confidence.

→ [Production Deployment Guide](/tutorials/production-deployment)

**Topics covered:**
- Choosing the right backend
- Kubernetes deployment with Helm
- Security hardening (auth, encryption, policy engine)
- High availability and failover
- Performance tuning
