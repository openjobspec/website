## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Backend** | A server implementation of the OJS specification that stores and manages jobs. Examples: ojs-backend-redis, ojs-backend-postgres. |
| **Client** | An SDK component that produces jobs. The client enqueues jobs by sending them to the backend via HTTP or gRPC. |
| **Handler** | A function registered by a worker to process a specific job type. |
| **Job** | A unit of work described by a job envelope. Contains a type, arguments, and metadata. |
| **Job Envelope** | The complete data structure representing a job, including all required and optional fields. |
| **Middleware** | A composable function that wraps enqueue or execution logic, enabling cross-cutting concerns. |
| **Queue** | A named channel that holds jobs waiting to be processed. |
| **Worker** | An SDK component that consumes and processes jobs from one or more queues. |

## Lifecycle States

| State | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **scheduled** | Job is waiting for its `scheduled_at` time to arrive. |
| **available** | Job is ready to be fetched by a worker. |
| **pending** | Job has been claimed by a worker but processing has not started (transitional). |
| **active** | Job is currently being processed by a worker. |
| **completed** | Job handler returned success. Terminal state. |
| **retryable** | Job handler failed and the job is waiting for retry. |
| **cancelled** | Job was cancelled before completion. Terminal state. |
| **discarded** | Job exhausted retries and was discarded. Terminal state. |

## Reliability

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **At-least-once** | Delivery guarantee ensuring every job is processed at least once. May result in duplicates. |
| **Dead letter queue (DLQ)** | Storage for jobs that have permanently failed, available for inspection and manual retry. |
| **Idempotency** | Property of a handler where processing the same job multiple times produces the same result. |
| **Replay** | Re-enqueuing a dead letter job for another processing attempt. |
| **Visibility timeout** | Time a fetched job is reserved for a worker before becoming available again. |

## Scheduling

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Cron job** | A recurring job defined by a cron expression that triggers on a schedule. |
| **Delayed job** | A job with a future `scheduled_at` time, promoted to `available` when the time arrives. |
| **Overlap policy** | Strategy for handling a cron trigger when the previous instance is still running. |

## Worker Protocol

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Heartbeat** | Periodic signal from a worker to the backend indicating it is alive and reporting active jobs. |
| **Grace period** | Time allowed for in-flight jobs to complete during shutdown before forced termination. |
| **Quiet mode** | Worker state where it stops fetching new jobs but continues processing in-flight jobs. |

## Workflows

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Chain** | Sequential workflow: each step runs after the previous completes. |
| **Group** | Parallel workflow: all steps run concurrently, completing when all finish. |
| **Batch** | Parallel workflow with callbacks: steps run concurrently, a callback fires on completion. |

## Extensions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Backpressure** | Mechanism for handling producer overload when queues approach capacity. |
| **Codec** | An encode/decode function pair for transforming job payloads (encryption, compression). |
| **Conformance level** | A tier (0–4) indicating which specification features a backend implements. |
| **Extension** | An optional specification module that adds functionality beyond the core (retry, workflows, etc.). |
| **Rate limiting** | Controls on how fast jobs are processed, protecting downstream services. |
| **Unique job** | A job with deduplication constraints preventing duplicate processing. |

## Wire Formats & Protocols

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Job args** | An array of values passed to the job handler. OJS uses `args` (array), not `payload` (object). |
| **Meta** | A key-value map for arbitrary metadata attached to a job (trace context, tenant ID, etc.). |
| **UUIDv7** | Time-sortable UUID format used for job IDs, providing natural chronological ordering. |
