| Scale workers manually | Auto-scaling |
| Build dashboards | Pre-built |

## How It Works

```
1. Sign up at ojs.cloud (Google or GitHub SSO)
     ↓
2. Choose a backend (Redis recommended for most use cases)
     ↓
3. Get your API key and server URL
     ↓
4. Install any SDK:
   npm install @openjobspec/sdk
   pip install openjobspec
   go get github.com/openjobspec/ojs-go-sdk
     ↓
5. Start processing jobs:
   const client = new OJSClient({ url: 'https://YOUR-ID.ojs.cloud' });
   await client.enqueue('email.send', { to: 'user@example.com' });
```

## Features

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Each tenant gets:
- Dedicated API keys with RBAC (admin/operator/developer/viewer)
- Isolated queues and workers
- Per-tenant rate limiting and metering
- Audit logging

### Observability Built-In

- **Prometheus metrics** — scrape from your existing monitoring
- **Admin UI** — visual job management at `your-id.ojs.cloud/admin`
- **Usage dashboard** — jobs processed, error rates, queue depths
- **Billing portal** — invoices, usage history, plan management

### Security

- API key authentication (required, no insecure mode)
- TLS everywhere
- OIDC/SAML SSO (Enterprise plan)
- AES-256-GCM job payload encryption (Pro+ plans)
- SOC 2 Type II (planned)

## Self-Hosted vs Cloud

| Consideration | Self-Hosted | Cloud |
|--------------|:-----------:|:-----:|
| Time to first job | 5 minutes | 60 seconds |
| Infrastructure management | You | Us |
| Backend choice | All 6 | Tier-dependent |
| Customization | Full | API-level |
| Data location | Your servers | AWS (us-east-1) |
| Cost at 100K jobs/mo | ~$50 (infra) | $29 |
| Cost at 10M jobs/mo | ~$500 (infra) | $499 |

<Aside type="tip">
  **Recommendation:** Start with the free tier to evaluate. Migrate to self-hosted if you need full control or data locality requirements.
</Aside>

## FAQ

**Can I migrate from Cloud to self-hosted?**
Yes. OJS Cloud uses the same API as self-hosted backends. Change the URL in your SDK config and you're done. No data migration needed for new jobs.

**What happens if I exceed my plan limits?**
Jobs are rate-limited, not dropped. Upgrade your plan or wait for the next billing cycle.

**Is there a trial for paid plans?**
The free tier is permanent — no credit card required, no expiration. For Pro/Enterprise evaluation, contact sales@openjobspec.org.

**Where is data stored?**
AWS us-east-1 (N. Virginia). EU and APAC regions are on the roadmap for Enterprise plans.
