# Code of Conduct

## Our standards

We are committed to a welcoming, harassment-free community for everyone.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and constructive in communication
- Accepting feedback gracefully
- Focusing discussion on what is best for the project and community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Discriminatory or exclusionary language
- Publishing private information without permission

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards.
Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions
that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact project maintainers through
repository maintainership channels on GitHub. For sensitive reports, use a private
GitHub Security Advisory submission.

All reports will be reviewed and handled promptly and fairly.
